# portfolio1.2

Basic porfolio site build just for practicing frontEnd skills.

This is my portfolio which is currently hosted on netlify: https://muzzammil.netlify.app/
The reason I chose to host this site on netlify is that it sends user's form submission directly to my e-mail and its free.
Visit the site and send me a message (if you have time)ðŸ˜œ

I used javaScript for some basic scroll animation, I would use intersection observer api in my next porfolio site, and I would build it using react js.
I have alot to learn that's why I created this site from scrach and didn't use free online templates.

I have used the Continuous Deployment provided by netlify.
I have choosen the gitHub as the provider where my siteâ€™s source code is hosted. When you push to Git, netlify will run my build tool of choice on netlify's servers and deploy the result.

ðŸ˜‹ Thank you for reading.
