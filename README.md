# portfolio1.2

Basic portfolio site build just for practicing frontEnd skills.

This is my portfolio which is currently hosted on netlify: https://muzzammil.netlify.app/ The reason I chose to host this site on netlify is that it sends user's form submission directly to my e-mail and its free. Visit the site and send me a message (if you have time)ðŸ˜œ

I used javaScript for some basic scroll animation, I would use intersection observer api in my next portfolio site, and I would build it using react js. I have a lot to learn that's why I created this site from scratch and didn't use free online templates.

I have used the Continuous Deployment provided by netlify. I have chosen GitHub as the provider where my siteâ€™s source code is hosted. When you push to Git, netlify will run my build tool of choice on netlify's servers and deploy the result.

ðŸ˜‹ Thank you for reading.
